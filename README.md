## Task

* Pick a theme for your app. You will not be allowed to change theme after this lab.

    1. App should be complex one, from UI and business logic perspective. Think about implement some app which you desire to create for personal use or create clone of some interesting or popular app (twitter, instagram, gmail, linkedIn or others popular app from your smartphone)
    2. Your are allowed to use any public API of any service. Twitter, instagram, facebook and other big platforms has various public API which are very interesting. Connecting to API and fetching real data does not enter in scope of LAB 2.
    3. Some ingenious app ideas will be rated with higher marks. Be creative and try to create something new and not just clone existing ideas.

* Implement basic UI and layout of your app. Implement design for at least 3 functional screens, this means to create such screen as main home screen, feed or another screen which relates to app business logic.

    1. Don't focus on sign in / sign up screen (there is no so much fun in creating that screens), but you are encouraged to add them too.

* At least 1 screen should present collection of data, in other words list of elements.

    1. List should contain at least 30 elements. For this lab you could hardcode data which you will use in order to populate list, or it could be a dummy data, but it should be human readable.
    2. Try to implement list with multiple columns at least 2, also you could try to implement list with multiple directions of scrolling, like list where elements could scroll vertical as usually, and row could scroll horizontally (like Netflix on home feed)
    3. On Android you should use "RecyclerView", on iOS you should use "UICollectionView"

* Create your UI and layout to support portrait and landscape orientations and different screen sizes starting from phone with small screens (4 inch) to tablets with screen size 12 inch. Supporting of different screen sizes and orientation is mandatory.
